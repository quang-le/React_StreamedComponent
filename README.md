## React StreamedValue and StreamedComponent

The objective is to replicate the `StreamedValue` and `StreamedWidget` from [frideos']() [frideos_core]() package from Flutter in React.

These feature simplify the use of streams with the [Rx library]() by simplifying the syntax, leading to lighter, more readble code.

This is both a learning and quality of life project: as I'm using frideos' library to manage streams in Flutter: having similar feature available in React would allow me to easily use streams and the BloC pattern as I start working with React. Creating this library also allows me to explore React through the lens of my Flutter experience and is a good shot at comparing the 2 frameworks.
